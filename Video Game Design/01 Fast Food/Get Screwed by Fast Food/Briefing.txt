You work as a manager in a restaurant. So, you get access to food in the restaurant. 
But, you can only choose from given food options unless it's a dietary restriction. 
(Un)fortunately, you don't have any. 

Remember to watch your calorie requirements and also your money. You could lose 
if you aren't within the required ranges of your diet and budget. Everything you 
eat will have calories and how much it costs you. You will have three meals each 
day - breakfast, lunch, dinner.

You have $100 and will start with 2500 calories (which is perfect). 
Spend wisely!

Survive, if you can. Always be observant of your environment.
