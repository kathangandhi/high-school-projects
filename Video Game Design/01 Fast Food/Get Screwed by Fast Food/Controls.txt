The stats of your player will be at the top of screen. There will be 
a calorie range indicator, your current calorie level, and your 
current money.

Below it will be displayed the menu which you can choose from. Please
use the number next to the menu item to indicate your choice.

The calories of that item will be added to your range, but calories
will also be lost due to working after your meal. If your calorie 
level crosses the range, you lose. If you go broke, you lose too.
